# GUI example

This UML class diagram illustrates the Abstract Factory design pattern applied to creating user interface (UI) elements like buttons and checkboxes for different operating systems (OS).

## Components

* **Classes:**
  1. **Application** Represents the main application that uses UI elements (buttons and checkboxes).
  2. **Button (interface):** Defines the common functionality (`paint()`) for all button types.
  3. **Checkbox (interface):** Defines the common functionality (`paint()`) for all checkbox types.
  4. **Demo:** A class likely containing the `main()` function to demonstrate the application.
  5. **GUIFactory (interface):** Declares methods (`createButton()` and `createCheckbox()`) for creating specific UI elements. This promotes code that depends on factories rather than concrete UI classes.
  6. **LinuxButton, MacOSButton, WindowsButton:** Concrete button classes for each OS, implementing the `Button` interface.
  7. **LinuxCheckbox, MacOSCheckbox, WindowsCheckbox:** Concrete checkbox classes for each OS, implementing the `Checkbox` interface.
  8. **LinuxFactory, MacOSFactory, WindowsFactory:** Concrete factory classes implementing `GUIFactory`. Each factory creates UI elements specific to its OS (e.g., `LinuxFactory` creates `LinuxButton` and `LinuxCheckbox`).

* **Relationships**
  1. The `Application` class depends on both `Button` and `Checkbox` through usage dependencies (shown as plain arrows).
  2. The `Demo` class depends on the `Application` class (dashed arrow with `"«create»"` label) to potentially create the application object.
  3. The `Demo` class also depends on each concrete factory class (dashed arrows) to potentially retrieve the desired UI elements.
  4. Inheritance is shown with solid black arrows (e.g., `LinuxButton` inherits from `Button`).
  5. Interface implementation is shown with dashed green arrows (e.g., `LinuxButton` implements `Button`).
  6. Concrete factories use dashed arrows to indicate creation of specific UI elements (e.g., `LinuxFactory` creates `LinuxButton`).

## Benefits

1. **Decouples application from concrete UI elements:** The application doesn't need to know about specific OS-dependent buttons or checkboxes. It just relies on the `GUIFactory` interface.
2. **Flexibility for different UI types:** You can easily add new factories for different UI frameworks (e.g., web) without modifying the core application logic.

## Learning Points

1. This code demonstrates the Abstract Factory pattern for creating UI elements based on the operating system.
2. Interfaces define the core functionalities, while concrete classes implement them for specific OSs.
3. Factory classes encapsulate the logic of creating these concrete UI elements.
4. This approach promotes loose coupling and easier extensibility for the application.
